# developer-profile-generator
 A command-line application that dynamically generates a PDF profile from a GitHub username. Running the application from the command line will require some user input (github username and favorite color).


## Context

When preparing a report for stakeholders, it is important to have up-to-date information about members of the development team. Rather than navigating to each team member's GitHub profile, a command-line application will allow for quick and easy generation of profiles in PDF format.

The application will be invoked with the following command:

node index.js

The user will be prompted for their github username.

The user will be prompted for a favorite color, which will be used as the background color for cards.

The PDF will be populated with the following:

* Profile image
* User name
* Location
* User blog
* User bio
* Number of public repositories
* Number of followers
* Number of GitHub stars
* Number of users following
